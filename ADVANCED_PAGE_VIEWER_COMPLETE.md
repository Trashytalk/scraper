# Advanced Page Viewer System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive **Advanced Page Viewer System** that provides three key capabilities:

1. **📄 Full Page Rendering** - View scraped pages exactly as they appeared, with embedded assets
2. **🖼️ Image Gallery** - Browse and download all images found in scraped content  
3. **🕸️ Network Diagram** - Visualize the crawl path and relationships between pages

## 🏗️ Architecture

### CFPL (Capture-First, Process-Later) Storage
- **Content-Addressed Store (CAS)** - Deduplicates identical content using SHA256 hashing
- **Immutable Raw Zone** - Original captured content never changes
- **Manifest System** - Tracks all URLs, assets, and metadata
- **SQLite Catalog** - Fast indexing and relationship tracking

### Components Created

#### Backend Components
1. **`cfpl_page_viewer.py`** - Core viewer engine with CLI interface
2. **`cfpl_storage_init.py`** - Storage initialization and sample data creation
3. **Backend API Endpoints** - REST APIs for frontend integration:
   - `/api/cfpl/page-content` - Get rendered page with assets
   - `/api/jobs/{job_id}/urls` - List all URLs in a job
   - `/api/cfpl/network-diagram/{job_id}` - Generate network visualization
   - `/api/cfpl/export-bundle` - Download complete page archives

#### Frontend Components
1. **`PageViewerModal.tsx`** - Complete React modal with 3 tabs:
   - **Page View Tab** - Iframe rendering with viewer controls
   - **Image Gallery Tab** - Grid view of all images with download
   - **Network Diagram Tab** - Crawl path visualization
2. **Integration** - Added "🔍 Advanced View" button to job results

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Page View Tab
- **Offline Rendering** - Pages work without internet connection
- **Embedded Assets** - CSS, images, and scripts included as data URLs
- **Viewer Controls** - Overlay showing page metadata, status, size
- **URL Selector** - Switch between different pages in the same job
- **Responsive Design** - Scales to different screen sizes

### 2. Image Gallery Tab
- **Thumbnail Grid** - Visual preview of all extracted images
- **Metadata Display** - Shows image URL, type, size, discovery method
- **Bulk Download** - Download individual images or entire collections
- **Format Support** - Handles all image types (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP)

### 3. Network Diagram Tab
- **Crawl Statistics** - Pages crawled, domains, max depth, connections
- **Discovery Order** - Shows the sequence pages were found
- **Domain Breakdown** - Groups pages by domain with size statistics
- **Status Indicators** - Visual badges for HTTP status codes
- **Depth Visualization** - Shows how deep the crawler went

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Initialize CFPL storage with sample data
python cfpl_storage_init.py --with-sample-data

# Render a page as HTML
python cfpl_page_viewer.py render https://example.com/page --output page.html

# Extract images from a page
python cfpl_page_viewer.py images https://example.com/page --output-dir ./images/

# Generate network diagram
python cfpl_page_viewer.py network run_123 --output network.json

# Export complete page bundle
python cfpl_page_viewer.py export https://example.com/page ./page_bundle/
```

### Web Interface Usage
1. **Start servers**: Backend on :8000, Frontend on :5174
2. **Login**: admin / admin123
3. **View completed job** - Click "🔍 Advanced View" button
4. **Navigate tabs**:
   - **Page View**: See rendered page with controls
   - **Image Gallery**: Browse and download images
