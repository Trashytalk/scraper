## 🚀 **Ready for Live Testing**

### **1. Production Deployment**
```bash
# One-command deployment
git clone https://github.com/Trashytalk/scraper.git
cd scraper
docker-compose -f business_intel_scraper/docker-compose.yml up --build

# Services will be available at:
# - Frontend Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
# - API Backend: http://localhost:8000
# - Monitoring: http://localhost:9090 (Prometheus)
# - Analytics: http://localhost:3001 (Grafana)
```

### **2. Test Data Creation**
```bash
# Create sample business entities
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/entities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "label": "TechCorp Analytics",
    "entity_type": "organization",
    "properties": {"industry": "BI", "employees": 750}
  }'

# Run comprehensive validation
python database_success_test.py
python test_comprehensive_platform.py
```
