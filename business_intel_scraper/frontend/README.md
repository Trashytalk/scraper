# Frontend Development Setup

This directory holds a minimal frontend application. The only dependency is listed in `package.json`, but running `npm install` ensures all Node modules are present.

## Install Node dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Start the development server

Use the following command to serve the `public` folder locally.

```bash
npm start
```

The server runs on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by default.
