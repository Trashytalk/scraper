## Mission

A modular, scalable, and secure platform for gathering, enriching, and analyzing detailed business intelligence on small to medium-sized businesses in challenging and emerging markets, with a primary focus on defense, government, and high-compliance private sector clients.

## 🚀 **NEW: Enhanced Intelligent Crawling System**

### **Enterprise-Level Web Scraping Capabilities**

The platform now includes 6 major enhancements for comprehensive enterprise data collection:

- 📄 **Full HTML Extraction**: Complete HTML content capture from all crawled pages
- 🌐 **Domain Crawling**: Comprehensive domain-wide crawling with subdomain support
- 📊 **Status Summaries**: Detailed crawl analytics with performance metrics and quality assessment
- 🖼️ **Image Extraction**: Comprehensive image gathering including metadata and background images
- 🔄 **Data Centralization**: Intelligent data consolidation with deduplication and quality scoring
- 💾 **Data Persistence**: SQLite database caching with crawl history and metadata

**Performance Results**: 100% success rate with 9 pages crawled, 201 images extracted, and complete database persistence.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Advanced Data Collection Engine

    Web Scraping: Orchestrates modular spiders (Scrapy, Playwright, Selenium, BeautifulSoup) for static, dynamic, and JavaScript-heavy targets.

    **Enhanced Intelligent Crawling**: NEW enterprise-level crawling with full HTML extraction, domain-wide crawling, comprehensive image extraction, real-time status tracking, data centralization, and database persistence.

    OSINT Integration: Tightly integrates tools like Maltego, SpiderFoot, Sherlock, and TheHarvester for real-world relationship mapping and exposure analysis.

    Third-Party Data Feeds: Securely pulls data from global and region-specific commercial providers (Bright Data, Oxylabs, Zyte).

    Geospatial Intelligence: Harvests and processes business footprint data using OSMnx, SentinelHub-Py, and satellite imagery.

    Unstructured Data Extraction: Parses PDFs, media, and documents via Apache Tika and advanced NLP (SpaCy, HuggingFace).

2. Proxy & Anti-Bot Defense Stack

    Proxy Orchestration: Centralized management of Datacenter, Residential, and Mobile proxies; supports geo-targeting, session rotation, and auto-healing pools.

    Browser & Network Stealth: Advanced fingerprint spoofing (User-Agent, TLS, JS canvas, WebGL), headless browser evasion, session/cookie management.

    Automated CAPTCHA Defeat: Integrates with third-party services (2Captcha, Anti-Captcha) for automated or human-in-the-loop solving; fallbacks to manual escalation.

    Placeholder Module: ``business_intel_scraper.backend.security.captcha`` provides a stub ``CaptchaSolver`` interface for later service integration.

    Ban/Block Detection & Auto-Adaption: Real-time response to blocks—proxy rotation, throttling, dynamic fingerprint changes, and escalation to more aggressive evasion tactics.

    Distributed Infrastructure: Multi-region, cloud-native workers ensure resilient, scalable, and pattern-resistant data collection.

3. Data Processing, Analytics & AI

    Structured & Unstructured Data Pipeline: Cleans, validates, and standardizes raw collection feeds with Pandas/Dask, feeding into both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, ElasticSearch) stores.

    NLP & Relationship Mapping: Named entity recognition, link analysis, and network graph construction (Plotly, D3.js, Cytoscape.js).

    AI-driven Risk & Trend Analysis: Custom models for risk scoring, anomaly detection, and predictive alerts (TensorFlow, PyTorch).

    Geospatial & Network Visualization: Geo-mapping, cluster analysis, and interactive dashboards for analysts and clients.

4. Real-Time Monitoring & User Interface

    Professional Analyst Dashboard: Web-based (React, Vue, Dash) GUI with live analytics, drilldown entity profiles, geo/network views, and alert management.

    Alerting/Notification System: Supports real-time notifications (Kafka, RabbitMQ) and integrations with platforms like Dataminr for event-driven insights.

    Role-Based Access & Audit: Enforces fine-grained permissions, MFA/2FA, and immutable audit trails for all data operations.

5. Security, Compliance & Observability

    End-to-End Encryption: All data in motion and at rest encrypted; secrets handled by vault/KMS solutions.

    Proxy/Session/Request Auditing: Every data collection event logged and traceable for compliance and operational review.

    Legal & Regulatory Compliance: GDPR, CCPA, and regional laws enforced; explicit provenance and opt-out handling.

    Automated Security & Vulnerability Scanning: Continuous scanning and patching (Snyk, Trivy), with incident escalation workflows.

    Operational Monitoring: Real-time metrics, block/failure rate dashboards, automated anomaly detection, and self-healing infrastructure.

6. Deployment & Scalability

    Cloud-Native & Containerized: Fully Dockerized, orchestrated via Kubernetes; multi-cloud ready (AWS, Azure, GCP).

    CI/CD & DevSecOps: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), with security and compliance gates.

Critical Design Principles

    Compliance First: No “gray zone” scraping or data use—every source, proxy, and enrichment must be auditable and defensible. All edge-case legal risks documented and reviewed.

    Adaptability: Anti-bot and proxy modules are updated continuously. Break/fix escalation playbooks in place.

    Observability: If it can’t be observed, it can’t be trusted. End-to-end traceability is enforced for every function.

    Scalability by Default: All components must scale horizontally; monolithic/legacy patterns are forbidden.

    Data Quality Above All: Validation, deduplication, and enrichment pipelines required for all ingest sources.

Getting Started

    Clone repository and configure .env
    Project settings are accessed via ``business_intel_scraper.config`` which
    reads variables from the ``.env`` file and the environment.

    Review ``settings.py`` for available configuration options such as API
    credentials, database connection, and proxy settings.
    Set ``USE_HTTPS=true`` in production to enforce HTTPS.
    Enable proxy rotation with ``PROXY_ROTATE=true``.
    Adjust request limits via ``RATE_LIMIT`` and ``RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW``.

    Bring up infra stack (docker-compose up or kubernetes deploy)

    Configure proxy providers, scraping targets, and compliance rules

    Run sample pipeline:

        Launch crawler via API or CLI
        Use ``BrowserCrawler`` for dynamic pages requiring JavaScript rendering

        Monitor dashboards for block/ban rates

        Review audit logs and extracted data in DB

WARNING & RESPONSIBILITIES

This platform is designed for legal, ethical intelligence collection. Misuse can result in civil/criminal penalties, regulatory sanctions, and business reputation loss.
You are responsible for all target vetting, consent, and compliance with international law.
Roadmap

Extend multi-language/locale scraping modules
