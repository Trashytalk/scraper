- [ ] Advanced export & reporting

## ðŸš€ **Quick Wins (This Week)**

1. **Add Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add proper environment configuration
   ```

2. **Basic Testing Setup**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react jest
   python -m pytest business_intel_scraper/backend/tests/
   ```

3. **Docker Production Build**
   ```dockerfile
   # Multi-stage Docker build for optimization
   FROM node:18-alpine as frontend-build
   # ... frontend build steps
   
   FROM python:3.11-slim as backend
   # ... backend setup
   ```

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ci.yml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       # ... test steps
   ```

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics**
