## Installation

1. **Install Advanced Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Download Required Models**:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. **Install System Dependencies**:
   - For OCR: Install Tesseract OCR
   - For TOR: Install TOR service (optional, can use built-in)

## Configuration

### API Keys

Configure your API keys in the respective configuration tabs:
- **Clearbit**: Person and company enrichment
- **FullContact**: Contact information enrichment
- **Hunter.io**: Email verification and finding
- **Shodan**: IP and domain intelligence

### VPN Providers

Set up your VPN credentials in the Network Configuration tab:
- Username/password authentication
- Certificate-based authentication (where applicable)
- Server selection and optimization

### TOR Configuration

- Default configuration works out-of-the-box
- Custom exit node preferences
- Circuit rotation intervals
- Bridge configuration for restricted networks

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

- **Visualization**: Large datasets (>100k nodes) require significant RAM
- **ML Models**: Transformer models can use 1-4GB GPU/CPU memory
- **Browser**: Each tab uses ~100-200MB

### CPU Usage

- **Data Processing**: ML operations are CPU-intensive
- **Network Operations**: Concurrent connections managed efficiently
- **Visualization Rendering**: GPU acceleration when available

### Storage

- **Models**: ML models require 500MB-2GB disk space
- **Cache**: Browser and data cache can grow to several GB
- **Logs**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis

## Security Notes

### Data Privacy

- All processing done locally unless using external APIs
- API credentials encrypted in local configuration
- Optional data anonymization features

### Network Security

- TOR integration provides anonymity
- VPN integration adds another layer of protection
- Proxy rotation prevents tracking and blocking

### OSINT Ethics

- Respect rate limits and terms of service
- Only investigate public information
- Follow legal and ethical guidelines

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Install missing dependencies
2. **API Failures**: Check credentials and quotas
3. **TOR Connection Issues**: Verify TOR service is running
4. **Visualization Performance**: Reduce node count or use 2D mode
5. **Browser Issues**: Clear cache and restart application

### Logging

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```python

import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

```

### Support

- Check logs in the "Logs" tab for errors
- Review configuration settings
- Consult API provider documentation
- Update dependencies regularly

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Integrations

- Extend API providers by subclassing `APIProvider`
