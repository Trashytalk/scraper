# Quick Start Script Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Health Endpoint Mismatch

**Problem**: The `quick_start.sh` script was checking `/health` but the backend server serves the health endpoint at `/api/health`.

**Fix**: Updated all health check URLs in the script from:
- `http://localhost:$BACKEND_PORT/health`
- To: `http://localhost:$BACKEND_PORT/api/health`

**Files Changed**: `quick_start.sh` (lines with health checks)

### 2. Frontend Port Mismatch

**Problem**: The script expected the frontend on port 5174, but Vite is configured to run on port 5173.

**Fix**: Updated the `FRONTEND_PORT` variable from `5174` to `5173` to match the Vite configuration.

**Files Changed**: `quick_start.sh` (line 43)

### 3. Long Startup Times

**Problem**: The script waited too long (30-40 seconds) for servers to start, causing user frustration.

**Fix**:
- Reduced backend startup timeout from 30 to 20 seconds
- Reduced frontend startup timeout from 40 to 30 seconds (15 iterations Ã— 2 seconds)
- Added log output when timeouts occur to help debugging

### 4. Poor Error Reporting

**Problem**: When servers failed to start, there was limited information for debugging.

**Fix**: Added automatic log tail output when startup fails:
- Shows last 10 lines of backend.log on backend failure
- Shows last 5 lines of frontend.log on frontend timeout
- Added "Check logs/[service].log for more details" messages

### 5. Incorrect Access Information

**Problem**: The success message showed incorrect URLs for API testing.

**Fix**: Updated all reference URLs in the success message to use correct endpoints:
- Health check: `http://localhost:8000/api/health`
- Test commands now show correct `/api/health` endpoint

### 6. Frontend React Hooks Order Issue

**Problem**: After login, the frontend showed a blank white screen with React Hooks order errors in the console.

**Fix**: Moved the third `useEffect` hook before the early return for the login screen to ensure all hooks are called in the same order every render.

**Files Changed**: `business_intel_scraper/frontend/src/App.tsx` (moved useEffect from line 1263 to before line 1042)

## Testing

Created `test_quick_start_fixes.sh` to verify all fixes are properly applied. All tests pass.

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Faster Startup**: Reduced waiting time from ~70 seconds to ~50 seconds maximum
2. **Correct Port Detection**: Frontend properly detected on port 5173
3. **Working Health Checks**: Backend health endpoint correctly identified
4. **Better Error Messages**: Clear debugging information when things go wrong
5. **Accurate URLs**: Success message shows correct access URLs

## Usage

The script should now work much better:

```bash

./quick_start.sh

```

Expected URLs after successful startup:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173/
- Backend API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/api/health

## Verification Commands

Test the fixes before running:

```bash

./test_quick_start_fixes.sh

```

Check service status:

```bash

./quick_start.sh --status

```

Stop services if needed:

```bash

./quick_start.sh --stop

```
