# 🔐 Authentication Fix Guide

## 📊 **Current Status: FIXED**

The backend server is now running correctly on port 8000 with authentication working properly.

## 🎯 **Solution Summary**

The issue was that:

- You should see a **🔐 TACTICAL ACCESS** login form

### 2. **Login Credentials**

- **Password**: `admin123`

### 3. **What Happens After Login**

- Job 196 will be the first job in the clean system
