# Web Scraper Enhancement Fixes - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Fixes

### 1. Images Not Appearing in Advanced View Image Gallery
**Status: FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Images appeared in 'View Results' popup but not in 'Advanced View' -> 'Image Gallery'
- **Root Cause**: Image Gallery was accessing basic assets without proper metadata
- **Solution**: Enhanced backend `/api/cfpl/page-content` endpoint to include image metadata (alt_text, title, dimensions, css_class)
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `backend_server.py` to format image assets with enhanced metadata
  - Enhanced `PageViewerModal.tsx` Image Gallery to display metadata and proper fallback handling
  - Added TypeScript interfaces for enhanced asset properties

### 2. Page View Not Showing Offline Archive
**Status: FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: 'Page View' didn't show exact replica of scraped page for offline viewing
- **Root Cause**: HTML generation wasn't creating true offline archives with proper styling
- **Solution**: Enhanced HTML generation to create sophisticated offline replicas
- **Changes Made**:
  - Improved HTML content generation in `backend_server.py` with comprehensive CSS styling
  - Added responsive design, proper typography, and mobile-friendly layouts
  - Enhanced content preservation to maintain original page structure

### 3. Videos Not Being Scraped
**Status: FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Video content wasn't being extracted during scraping
- **Root Cause**: Missing video extraction functionality in scraping engine
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive video extraction capabilities
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added `_extract_videos()` method to `ScrapingEngine` class
  - Supports HTML5 video tags, embedded videos (YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion), and direct video links
  - Enhanced backend API to properly format video assets with platform detection
  - Updated frontend to display videos in enhanced Media Gallery (formerly Image Gallery)

### 4. Links Not Showing in Network Diagram
**Status: FIXED** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Network diagram wasn't displaying extracted links
- **Root Cause**: Network diagram edge generation wasn't properly creating edges from extracted links
- **Solution**: Enhanced network diagram generation logic
- **Changes Made**:
  - Fixed edge creation logic in `backend_server.py` network diagram endpoint
  - Improved link processing to create proper source-target relationships
  - Added hierarchical edge styling with different colors for parent-child vs cross-links
  - Fixed TypeScript errors in React Flow MarkerType usage

### 5. Enhanced Media Gallery (Images + Videos)
