- **WebSocket integration** for live data updates
- **Service status overview** with color-coded health indicators
- **Alert management** and historical data visualization

### üöÄ Quick Start Guide

#### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/homebrew/scraper

# Make monitoring script executable (already done)
chmod +x monitoring/start_monitoring.sh

# Install dependencies and validate configuration
./monitoring/start_monitoring.sh install
./monitoring/start_monitoring.sh validate
```

#### 2. Start Monitoring
```bash
# Start the complete monitoring system
./monitoring/start_monitoring.sh start

# Check status
./monitoring/start_monitoring.sh status

# View live logs
./monitoring/start_monitoring.sh logs
```

#### 3. Access Dashboard
```bash
# Start the web dashboard (in a separate terminal)
python3 monitoring_dashboard.py

# Open in browser: http://localhost:8888
```

#### 4. Health Checks
```bash
# Run manual health check
./monitoring/start_monitoring.sh health

# Run with JSON output for automation
./monitoring/start_monitoring.sh health --json
```

### üìä Monitoring Features

#### Real-time Metrics
- **System Resources**: CPU, Memory, Disk usage with trend analysis
- **API Performance**: Response times, request rates, error tracking
- **Database Health**: Connection status, query performance
- **Cache Performance**: Redis connectivity and response times

#### Intelligent Alerting
- **Multi-level severity**: Info, Warning, Critical with escalation
- **Multiple channels**: Console, file, email, webhook (Slack integration ready)
- **Configurable thresholds**: Customizable for your environment
- **Alert aggregation**: Prevents spam from repeated issues

#### Historical Analysis
- **Metrics storage**: SQLite database with 30-day retention
- **Performance trends**: Track system performance over time
- **Downtime tracking**: Record and analyze service interruptions
- **Capacity planning**: Historical data for scaling decisions

### üîß Configuration Customization

#### Environment-Specific Settings
Edit `monitoring/config.json` to match your production environment:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "database_url": "postgresql://your-user:password@localhost:5432/your-db",
    "redis_url": "redis://localhost:6379/0",
    "api_base_url": "http://your-domain.com:8000"
  },
  
  "alerts": {
    "email": {
      "smtp_host": "your-smtp-server.com",
      "smtp_username": "your-monitoring-email@domain.com",
      "to_emails": ["admin@domain.com", "devops@domain.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Threshold Tuning
Adjust monitoring thresholds based on your hardware:
- **CPU Warning**: 80% (adjust for your server capacity)
- **Memory Critical**: 95% (consider your application's memory needs)
- **Response Time Warning**: 1000ms (tune for your performance requirements)

### üìà Production Integration

#### Automated Deployment
The monitoring system integrates seamlessly with your existing deployment:
- **Docker compatibility**: Monitors containerized services
- **Systemd integration**: Can be configured as a system service
- **CI/CD ready**: Health checks can be integrated into deployment pipelines

#### Scalability Features
- **Horizontal scaling**: Can monitor multiple application instances
- **Load balancer integration**: Tracks performance across multiple servers
- **Microservices support**: Individual service monitoring and alerting

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Reliability

#### Monitoring Security
- **No sensitive data logging**: Passwords and tokens are excluded
- **Secure configuration**: Configuration file permissions can be restricted
- **Rate limiting awareness**: Monitors for suspicious activity patterns

#### Reliability Features
- **Self-monitoring**: The monitoring system monitors its own health
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues operating even if some components fail
- **Automatic recovery**: Restarts failed monitoring components
